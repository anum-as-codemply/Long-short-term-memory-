This code help build and evaluate deep learning models using both the FNG values and simple closing prices to determine if the FNG indicator provides a better signal for cryptocurrencies than the normal closing price data using deep learning recurrent neural networks.

Here's the tasks, the code will perform:
- Prepare the data for training and testing
- Build and train custom LSTM RNNs
- Evaluate the performance of each model
